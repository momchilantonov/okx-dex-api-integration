Swap#
Generate the data to call the OKX DEX router to execute a swap.

Note
In Uni v3 pools, the following scenario may occur:
If the liquidity for the desired token pair in the pool is depleted, the pool will only consume part of the payment token, leaving a remainder.
As a fully decentralized smart contract, the OKX DEX Router will automatically refund the remainder.
During your integration, please ensure compatibility with this scenario by configuring your contract to support token refunds, thereby ensuring a smooth user experience.

Request param#
Parameter	Type	Required	Description
chainId	String	Yes	Chain ID (e.g., 1 for Ethereum. See Chain IDs)
amount	String	Yes	The input amount of a token to be sold
(set in minimal divisible units, e.g., 1.00 USDT set as 1000000, 1.00 DAI set as 1000000000000000000), you could get the minimal divisible units from Tokenlist.
fromTokenAddress	String	Yes	The contract address of a token you want to send (e.g.,0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
toTokenAddress	String	Yes	The contract address of a token you want to receive (e.g.,0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48)
slippage	String	Yes	Slippage limit.

Note:
1. For EVM networks, the slippage setting has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.
2. For Solana, the slippage setting has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of less than 1.

(For example: 0.005 means that the maximum slippage for this transaction is 0.5%, while 1 means that the maximum slippage of this transaction is 100%.)
userWalletAddress	String	Yes	User's wallet address (e.g.,0x3f6a3f57569358a512ccc0e513f171516b0fd42a)
swapReceiverAddress	String	No	Recipient address of a purchased token if not set, userWalletAddress will receive a purchased token (e.g.,0x3f6a3f57569358a512ccc0e513f171516b0fd42a)
feePercent	String	No	The percentage of fromTokenAmount or toTokenAmount will be sent to the referrer’s address, the rest will be set as the input amount to be sold. Min percentage: 0. Max percentage: 3.
Maximum 2 decimal points. Longer sections will be automatically omitted. (E.g. 1.326% is the actual input, but the final calculation will only adopt 1.32%.)
fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress	String	No	The wallet address to receive the commission fee from the fromToken.
When using the API, you need to configure the commission ratio using feePercent.
Each transaction can only choose commission from either the fromToken or the toToken.

Note:
1. For EVM chains: Transactions involving wrapped pairs, such as ETH and WETH, are not supported here.
2. For Solana chain: The commission address must have some SOL deposited in advance for activation.
toTokenReferrerWalletAddress	String	No	The wallet address to receive the commission fee from the toToken.
When using the API, you need to configure the commission ratio using feePercent.
Each transaction can only choose commission from either the fromToken or the toToken.

Note:
1. For EVM chains: Transactions involving wrapped pairs, such as ETH and WETH, are not supported here.
2. For Solana chain: The commission address must have some SOL deposited in advance for activation.
gaslimit	String	No	（Optional, The gas (in wei) for the swap transaction. If the value is too low to achieve the quote, an error will be returned
gasLevel	String	No	(Optional, defaults to average) The target gas price level for the swap transaction,set to average or fast or slow
dexIds	String	No	DexId of the liquidity pool for limited quotes, multiple combinations separated by , (e.g., 1,50,180, see liquidity list for more)
directRoute	Boolean	No	The default setting is false. When enabled, Direct Routes restrict our routing to a single liquidity pool only. Currently, this feature is only active for Solana swaps.
priceImpactProtectionPercentage	String	No	(Optional. The default is 90%.) The percentage (between 0 - 1.0) of the price impact allowed.

When the priceImpactProtectionPercentage is set, if the estimated price impact is above the percentage indicated, an error will be returned. For example, if PriceImpactProtectionPercentage = .25 (25%), any quote with a price impact higher than 25% will return an error.

This is an optional feature, and the default value is 0.9. When it’s set to 1.0 (100%), the feature will be disabled, which means that every transaction will be allowed to pass.

Note: If we’re unable to calculate the price impact, we’ll return null, and the price impact protection will be disabled.
callDataMemo	String	No	You can customize the parameters to be sent on the blockchain in callData by encoding the data into a 128-character 64-bytes hexadecimal string. For example, the string “0x...111” needs to keep the “0x” at its start.
computeUnitPrice	String	No	Used for transactions on the Solana network and similar to gasPrice on Ethereum. This price determines the priority level of the transaction. The higher the price, the more likely that the transaction can be processed faster.
computeUnitLimit	String	No	Used for transactions on the Solana network and analogous to gasLimit on Ethereum, which ensures that the transaction won’t take too much computing resource.
autoSlippage	Boolean	No	Default is false. When set to true, the original slippage (if set) will be covered by the autoSlippage and the API will calculate and return auto slippage recommendations based on current market data.
maxAutoSlippage	String	No	When autoSlippage is set to true, this value is the maximum auto slippage returned by the API. We recommend that users adopt this value to ensure risk control.
referrerAddress	String	No	Legacy Referrer address for fromtoken commission.For SOL commission using wallet address and SPL token commissions using token account.
Recommend to use the newfromTokenReferrerWalletAddress parameter
When using the API, you need to configure the commission ratio using feePercent.
Each transaction can only choose commission from either the fromToken or the toToken.

Note:
1. For EVM chains: Transactions involving wrapped pairs, such as ETH and WETH, are not supported here.
2. For Solana chain: The commission address must have some SOL deposited in advance for activation.
toTokenReferrerAddress	String	No	Legacy Referrer address for toToken commission (Only supports SPL Token commissions which use token account.)
Recommend to use the new toTokenReferrerWalletAddress parameter
When using the API, you need to configure the commission ratio using feePercent.
Each transaction can only choose commission from either the fromToken or the toToken.

Note:
1. For EVM chains: Transactions involving wrapped pairs, such as ETH and WETH, are not supported here.
2. For Solana chain: The commission address must have some SOL deposited in advance for activation.
