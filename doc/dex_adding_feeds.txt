Adding Fees#
The OKX DEX API supports configuring referral fees and fee-receiving addresses for token swaps

You can extend the implementation to include fee parameters in your swap quotes and charge up to 3% per swap from your users.

The OKX DEX API plans to take a certain percentage of the referral fee charged by you to your users. Currently the OKX DEX API charges no fees.

Note
Ton chain currently does not support commission splitting.
// Extended quoteParams with fee support
const quoteParams = {
    chainId: SOLANA_CHAIN_ID,
    amount: rawAmount,
    fromTokenAddress,
    toTokenAddress,
    slippage: "0.5",
    userWalletAddress: userAddress,
    // Fee-related parameters
    fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "Your_REFERRER_WALLET_ADDRESS", // Optional: Referrer address for commissions based on fromToken
    toTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "REFERRER_WALLET", // Optional: Referrer address for commissions based on toToken
    feePercent: "1.5",  // Optional: Commission percentage (0-3%, max 2 decimal points)

} as Record<string, string>;
Important Fee Configuration Notes:

The feePercent parameter must be between 0 and 3%
Maximum 2 decimal points are supported for feePercent E.g. 1.326% is the actual input, but the final calculation will only adopt 1.32%
For Solana , the commission address must have some SOL deposited for activation
Each transaction can only choose commission from either the fromToken or the toToken
Example Usage with Fees:

// .. Previous code implementation
    // Get swap quote
    const quoteParams = {
        chainId: SOLANA_CHAIN_ID,
        amount: rawAmount,
        fromTokenAddress,
        toTokenAddress,
        slippage: "0.5",
        userWalletAddress: userAddress,

        // Additional Fee params
        fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "fee-recipient-wallet-address",
        feePercent: "1",

        // The wallet addresses to receive the commission fee (Each transaction can only choose commission from either the fromToken or the toToken)
        // toTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "fee-recipient-wallet-address",
        // fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "fee-recipient-wallet-address",

    } as Record<string, string>;

    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = "/api/v5/dex/aggregator/swap";
    const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(quoteParams).toString();
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, "GET", requestPath, queryString);

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://www.okx.com${requestPath}${queryString}`,
        { method: "GET", headers }
    );

    const data = await response.json();

    // .. Continue code implementation
Command Line Usage with Fees:

# Example: Swap .01 SOL to USDC with 1.5% fee to referrer
npx ts-node swap.ts .01 11111111111111111111111111111111 EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v --referrer YOUR_REFERRER_ADDRESS --fee 1.5
Fee Calculation Example: For a trade of 100 USDC with a 1.5% fee:

Fee amount: 1.5 USDC (1.5% of 100 USDC)
Actual swap amount: 98.5 USDC
The fee (1.5 USDC) will be sent to the referrer address
